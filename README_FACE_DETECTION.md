# Face Detection and Recognition

This project demonstrates face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier.

## Features

- Detects faces in static images
- Uses pre-trained Haar cascade model for frontal face detection
- Draws rectangles around detected faces

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## How to Run

1. Save an image as `test.jpg` in the project directory.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python face_detection_recognition.py
```

3. A window will display the image with detected faces.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand classical face detection using Haar cascades
- Work with OpenCV for real-time computer vision
